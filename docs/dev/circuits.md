## Background of Invention

This invention is related to the field of quantum computing, specifically optical quantum computers and circuits.

The KLM Protocol is one of the most popular methods of creating optical circuits for quantum computing. By utilizing simple optical and electrical components, one can create any theoretical quantum circuit. It has been hypothesized that the KLM and similar protocols enable the mass manufacture of quantum circuits and quantum computers, however attempts at implementing the KLM and similar protocols have been unsuccessful due to issues in aligning optical components and the added complexity of multiple dimensions of movement due to each qubit requiring two physical paths running perpendicular to each other making it overly-difficult to accomplish useful quantum computing.

## Summary Of Invention

The invention is a device that consists of:

1. A logic component consisting of optical and/or electrical components arranged in such a manner as to:
   * Generate a wave-particle such as but not limited to a photon or phonon, or
   * Perform a specified transformation across the bloch sphere of a single-wave particle, or
   * Perform a multi-particle transformation such as a controlled-not, or
   * Perform a measurement operation on one or more qubits, or
   * Otherwise manipulate a qubit or a plurality of qubits to perform a quantum calculation, operation, or computation.
2. Mirrors (2) or other means of guiding a wave-particle into or out of the internal optical circuit from or to or both from and to a specified path..
3. A standardized packaging such that the outputs of one component physically align with the inputs of another.
4. Such a device may also include fiber-optic connectors that would enable the external circuit layout to achieve non-linearity while preserving the integrity of the internal linera circuits.
5. Such a device may also include a fiber-optic connection as shown in figure 5A allowing the connection of two or more components at any point in the circuit.
6. Such a device may also include mounting points such that multiple components can be stacked upon one another, soldered to a PCB board, or otherwise attached/affixed to a surface. Such mounting points may also include electrical leads consisting of a conductive material to allow for components to communicate with one another or with digital or analog hardware.
7. Such a device may include a case consisting of an external substrate capable of absorbing stray wave-particles that may attempt to enter or exit the device.
8. Such a device may be a macro component, micro component, or nano component.
9. Such a device may contain one or a plurality of other similar devices within its' housing provided such a device has at least one optical input or output.
